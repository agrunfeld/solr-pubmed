[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apurdy/solr-pubmed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apurdy/solr-pubmed)
=========

An [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) based tool for fetching, indexing and searching PubMed/MEDLINE records. 

Requirements
---------
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [Oracle JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
* Python 2.7
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html)

[Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is an easy to install Python distribution that doesnâ€™t require root or local admin privileges.

[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is recommended for create isolated Python development environments.

Get the code
------------
This repo contains submodules, so use the following command to clone the repository and it's dependencies:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/apurdy/solr-pubmed.git

Building
---------

    cd solr-pubmed
    mvn install

Running Tests
-------------
To execute all unit tests, use:

    mvn test

Starting the Solr Server
-------------
To run the configured Solr instance on a local Jetty server, use:

    cd solr-pubmed/solr-config
    mvn jetty:run-war

The Solr instance will run on [http://localhost:8983/core0/](http://localhost:8983/core0/) by default.

Fetching PubMed and PMC records
-------------
The retrieval directory contains python scripts for downloading PubMed records using the Entrez E-Utils and PMC Open Access Web services. 

We recommend using [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to manage your python development environments. 

To ensure you have the neccesary python dependencies needed to run the scripts, run the following command in the root directory of the retrieval module:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Indexing the sample records
-------------
A collection of utility methods for indexing MEDLINE records can be found in the `ingestion.SolrUtils` class under the `entrez-parsers` module.

Running the Solr frontend
-------------
The `solr-frontend` module consists of a lightweight [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application, which is essentially a thin presentation layer built on the Solr REST interface. The UI provides several features including keyword search, faceted searching, dynamic faceting using document clustering and highlighting. Before running the flask application make sure the required python packages are installed using pip:

    cd solr-frontend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
If you're on Windows using the Anaconda python distribution, you may run into issues installing the MarkupSafe package. If so, you can solve this issue by modifying `cygwinccompiler.py` as desribed here: [http://bugs.python.org/issue21821](http://bugs.python.org/issue21821)

To run the app:

    python app.py

The Flask server will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) by default.
